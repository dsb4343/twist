The readme.md file on your GitHub repository should include the following information:

1.) A list of students you collaborated with on this project

1.) Terrill Leaton, Jordan Bauchman, and Wes Nelson

2.) Description of the main learning objectives for this project
 
2.) Backend Development, Frontend Development, Administration Section Creation, and Addition of             Registration Forms

3.) A clear description of what you contributed to this project

3.) I worked on parts of the Backend Development, parts of the Frontend Development with a focus on the     Navigation Menus and the webpage responsiveness.

4.) Description of challenges that you ran into and the process of how you worked through the issues

4.) Problems with Async - I received assistance from the professor and learned when to use Async and         when not to, which fixed many of the issues early on.
    Branch Collaboration Issues on GitHub - I received help from Nicholas Crombie who was part of another group he instructed me that you can use Visual Studio Code and it has built in Git functions to assist you with switching to your branch after cloning from the master on GitHub, pulling from the master, and then being able to make your changes before pushing them up to your branch that is associated with the original master that you cloned from. You then can merge the branches with the master and repeat as necessary to keep all of your changes up to date. 
    The utilization of Pug - This was addressed late in the game with an HTML to pug converter that I found online. It was a great resource that I found useful to help learn pug until you are proficient with it enough in order to only have to use it occasionally as a reference tool. It was very helpful
    Problems with consistancy - In the beginning we struggled with case sensitivity, plural / singular names for different ID's, basically this should have been planned out in the very beginning, so that we could have had a consistant naming scheme for all of the objects for the site, which would have led to fewer errors throughout the development of the web project
    
5.) List features that are incomplete or need improvements if given more time

5.) A little more work with the responsiveness of the webpage in regards to when viewing it from a           smartphone, the images that are displayed on the website would only appear on tablets and desktops
    We also implemented a hamburger menu for viewing on a smartphone that we didn't have enough time to get functioning properly. Ultimately, I felt pretty good about the site overall. However, there were also some parts on the backend development which mainly involved the scheduling that we would have liked to finish making changes to. 

6.) Reflection on how you would approach this project differently if you were to start over

6.) I would be sure that our group had a leader who would help the group stay on task throughout the         entirity of the project and who would also do a good job of delegating tasks out to everyone in the     group. I would also communicate better with my group members through sites like slack or other           social media avenues in order to keep them up to date on my progress and also to be able to             collaborate better with the overall development of the project, including being able to help             each other with some of the more difficult tasks.
